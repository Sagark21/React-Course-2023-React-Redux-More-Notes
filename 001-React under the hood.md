 **Here's an example to illustrate how React and ReactDOM work together:**

**Imagine you're building a website for a pizza shop.**

**Using React, you might create components like:**

- **PizzaCard:** A component that displays a single pizza with its name, image, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.
- **Menu:** A component that lists multiple PizzaCards, allowing users to browse the available pizzas.
- **Cart:** A component that shows the pizzas the user has added to their cart, along with the total price and a checkout button.

**Here's how React and ReactDOM would work together to render the PizzaCard component:**

1. **You write the PizzaCard component in JavaScript:**

```javascript
function PizzaCard({ name, image, price }) {
  return (
    <div className="pizza-card">
      <img src={image} alt={name} />
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <p>Price: ${price}</p>
      <button>Add to Cart</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

2. **ReactDOM takes this component and renders it in the browser:**

```javascript
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import PizzaCard from './PizzaCard';

ReactDOM.render(<PizzaCard name="Pepperoni" image="pepperoni.jpg" price="12.99" />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

**Here's what happens behind the scenes:**

1. **React creates a virtual representation of the PizzaCard component in memory.**
2. **ReactDOM compares this virtual representation with the actual DOM (the browser's understanding of the web page).**
3. **If there are any differences, ReactDOM updates only the necessary parts of the DOM to reflect the changes in the component.**
4. **This efficient process makes React apps feel very responsive and fast.**

**So, in this example:**

- React is responsible for defining the structure and behavior of the PizzaCard component.
- ReactDOM is responsible for taking that component and actually making it appear on the screen in the correct place.

**By working together, React and ReactDOM make it easy to build complex and interactive web apps that feel smooth and fast to use.**
