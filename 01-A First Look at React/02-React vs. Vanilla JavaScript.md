**Comparing React with Vanilla JavaScript**

In this lecture, we will compare the React implementation of an advice app with a Vanilla JavaScript implementation. We will focus on how React keeps the user interface in sync with state.

**Key Differences**

* In React, everything is done in JavaScript, including the HTML. In Vanilla JavaScript, HTML is still in charge.
* In React, states are updated automatically, and React keeps the user interface in sync with these states. In Vanilla JavaScript, states need to be updated manually, and the DOM needs to be updated manually as well.
* In React, we don't need to select DOM elements manually. In Vanilla JavaScript, we need to select DOM elements manually.

**Conclusion**

React is good at keeping the data automatically in sync with the user interface. This is a fundamental difference between React and Vanilla JavaScript. As applications get bigger, this difference becomes more apparent.

**Additional Notes**

* The Vanilla JavaScript implementation is actually in an HTML file. This is just to keep everything in the same place.
* The HTML file includes the JavaScript. This is the opposite of how React does it.
* The get advice function is the heart of the application. This is where the data is updated and the DOM is updated.
* In React, we only need to set the new data. React takes care of updating the user interface.
* In Vanilla JavaScript, we need to manually update the DOM.
* React is not necessary for small applications. However, it becomes more useful as applications get bigger.

I hope this is helpful!
