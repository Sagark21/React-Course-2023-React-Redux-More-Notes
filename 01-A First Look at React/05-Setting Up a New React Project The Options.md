## Setting up a React Project

### Create-React-App

* Developed by Facebook many years ago
* Easy to set up and includes common development tools
* Uses outdated technologies and slow webpack bundler
* Not recommended for real-world projects

### Vite

* Modern build tool
* Fast hot module replacement and bundling
* Requires manual setup of ESLint, Prettier, and testing library
* Recommended for real-world projects

### React Frameworks

* Frameworks like Next.js and Remix provide solutions for routing, data fetching, and server-side rendering
* Can make it easier to build applications
* Not always necessary for simple projects
* Learning vanilla React is still important

### Recommendation

* Use Create-React-App for most projects in the course
* Use Vite for the last two or three projects to make them more modern
* Ignore the React team's advice to use a React framework for now
* Focus on learning vanilla React first
