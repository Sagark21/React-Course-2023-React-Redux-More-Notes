## Setting Up a React Project with Create-React-App

### Creating a New Project

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where you want to create the project.
2. Run the following command to create a new React project using Create-React-App:

```
npx create-react-app @5 my-app
```

3. Replace `my-app` with the name of your project.
4. Wait for Create-React-App to download all the necessary packages.

### File Structure

* `package.json`: Contains information about the project, such as the name, version, dependencies, and scripts.
* `node_modules`: Contains all the npm packages that have been installed for the project.
* `src`: Contains the source code for the project.
* `public`: Contains the assets that will end up in the final application, such as images and the index.html file.

### Starting the Project

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Open the terminal integrated into VS Code.
3. Run the following command to start the project:

```
npm start
```

4. This will start a web server and open the application in a new browser tab.

### Hot Module Replacement

1. Make a change to the `App` component.
2. Save the file.
3. The change should automatically be reflected in the browser window.

### Congratulations!

You have successfully created your first Create-React-App application.
