**Redux** is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It is a popular choice for managing global state in React applications.

**Key concepts**

* **Store:** A centralized container for all global state.
* **Reducer:** A pure function that calculates the next state based on the action and the current state.
* **Action:** An object that describes a state change.
* **Action creator:** A function that creates actions.
* **Dispatcher:** A function that dispatches actions to the store.

**How Redux works**

1. An action is created.
2. The action is dispatched to the store.
3. The store selects the appropriate reducer based on the action type.
4. The reducer calculates the next state based on the action and the current state.
5. The store updates its state to the new state.
6. Any components that are subscribed to the updated state are re-rendered.

**Benefits of using Redux**

* **Separation of concerns:** Redux separates state update logic from component logic.
* **Predictability:** Redux makes state updates predictable by using pure reducers.
* **Testability:** Redux makes state updates testable by using actions and reducers.

**When to use Redux**

* You have a lot of global state.
* You need to update state frequently.
* You need to share state across multiple components.

**Alternatives to Redux**

* **useReducer:** A built-in React hook for managing state.
* **Context API:** A React API for sharing state across components.
* **MobX:** A state management library that uses observables.
