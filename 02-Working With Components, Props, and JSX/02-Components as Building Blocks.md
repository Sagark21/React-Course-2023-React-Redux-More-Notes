Sure, here are the detailed notes from the paragraph with coding examples:

**Components: The Building Blocks of React**

* React applications are built entirely out of components.
* Each component encapsulates its own data, logic, and appearance.
* Components can be nested inside each other to create complex UIs.
* Component reusability is a key principle in React development.
* Component trees are used to visualize the hierarchy of components in a React app.
* Parent and child components are terms used to describe the relationship between nested components.

**Key Concepts**

* **Component:** The most fundamental building block of a React application.
* **Data:** The information that a component displays.
* **Logic:** The JavaScript code that controls the behavior of a component.
* **Appearance:** The HTML and CSS that defines the look and feel of a component.
* **Nesting:** The process of placing one component inside another.
* **Reusability:** The ability to use a component multiple times in an application.
* **Component Tree:** A visualization of the hierarchy of components in a React app.
* **Parent Component:** A component that contains another component.
* **Child Component:** A component that is contained within another component.

**Coding Examples**

```javascript
// A simple React component
function Question(props) {
  return (
    <div className="question">
      <h3>{props.title}</h3>
      <p>{props.body}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```javascript
// A parent component containing three child components
function QuestionsList() {
  return (
    <div className="questions-list">
      <Question title="What is React?" body="React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces." />
      <Question title="What are JSX?" body="JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files." />
      <Question title="What is a component?" body="A component is a reusable piece of code that encapsulates data, logic, and appearance." />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Next Steps**

* Learn more about component reusability.
* Start building your own React applications.
* Use component trees to visualize the structure of your React apps.
* Familiarize yourself with parent and child component terminology.
